# Invariable generation of alternating groups

Copyright &copy; 2022 Robert M. Guralnick, John Shareshian, and Russ Woodroofe

This code is in support of our paper _On invariable generation of alternating groups_ ([arXiv:2201.12371](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12371)).

The basic idea is that if _n_ is preceded by a prime number _r_ (at most _n_-3), and _p_<sup>_a_</sup> is a prime-power divisor of _n_ so that _r_ + _p_<sup>_a_</sup> &gt; _n_, then _A_<sub>_n_</sub> is generated by any _r_ cycle together with any element of order _p_<sup>_a_</sup> having a certain cycle structure.  We use fast C code to check which _n_ in a range of integers satisfies this condition.

Certain (rare) smooth numbers do not satisfy the condition, and for these we use slower GAP code to verify more complicated number-theoretic conditions which yield similar generation condition.  For details, please see the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.12371).

## Instructions for use
1.  Run `make` to build.  (Requirements: [primesieve library](https://github.com/kimwalisch/primesieve))
2.  Edit `batchjob` to match the number of simultaneous jobs and the size and number of ranges to examine.  By default, it outputs to files of the form out-_num_.g in your home directory.
3.  Run `./batchjob`.  Alternatively, `time ./batchjob`.
4.  Run `gap`.
5.  `Read("invgen_pub.g");` in `gap`.
6.  `InvgenCheckPhaseTwoFromFilesInDirectory("~/");` in `gap`.

This is research software, and may require tweaking for your specific circumstances.  It has been tested on macOS and Ubuntu Linux.

## Inventory
The project consists of the following main files.
### `invgen_sievelp.c`
This C program generates a list of integers _n_ where the prime preceding _n_-2 and the largest prime-power divisor of _n_ sum to at most _n_.  Thus, it generates a list of numbers that are [smooth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smooth_number), relative to the [prime gap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_gap) that they lie in.

The resulting command-line tool takes two arguments, which specify the first and last numbers in a range of positive integers.

The output is a GAP readable file, which sets variable `invgen_oversmooth_range` to the range of integers considered, and variable `invgen_oversmooth` to a list of entries of the form [_n_, _p_<sup>_a_</sup>], where _n_ is a smooth number and _p_<sup>_a_</sup> is the largest prime-power divisor of _n_.

### `batchjob`
This bash script runs a configurable number of parallel instances of `invgen_sievelp`, covering some given range.  It should be edited before a computation.  The variable `INVGEN_CHUNKSIZE` holds the size of each range, `INVGEN_STOPSTEP` holds the largest multiple of the chunk size to compute out to, and `INVGEN_NUMJOBS` holds the maximum number of simutaneous jobs to run.

The script is relatively unsophisticated, and waits for all current jobs to complete before beginning new ones.

### `invgen_pub.g`
This family of GAP functions has several functions.  The most important function is:
##### `InvgenCheckPhaseTwoFromFilesInDirectory`

Given a directory, this function looks for files matching the wildcard `out-\*.g` or `out-\*.g.gz`, which it expects to be output from `invgen_sievelp`.  It checks that the alternating group at each _n_ given is generated by any two elements having certain cycles structures (where one such element has prime order, the other prime-power order).

Also of note: `InvgenCheckInRange` is slower GAP code to check the same condition as in `invgen_sievelp`, together with the "Phase 2" check.  Several other functions work together to implement a [segmented sieve of Eratosthenes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes#Segmented_sieve).
